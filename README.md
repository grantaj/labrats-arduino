# Arduino for Musicians

**Alex Grant**

This is the repository for documentation and code for the
[Arduino for Musicians Workshop](
https://immersivelightandart.com.au/event/lab-rats-x-alex-grant-arduino-for-music-production-workshop-series/)
held at [Immersive Light and Art](https://immersivelightandart.com.au/), Adelaide, May-June 2025.

# Workshop Plan 

## Week 1 [Tues, May 13th]:
Introduction to Arduino: Focusing on the Arduino microcontroller, participants will be introduced to basics of electronics for electronic music and sound design.
 
## Week 2 [Tues, May 20th]:
MIDI: An introduction to the MIDI standard for interconnecting music equipment. Participants will learn how MIDI sends messages for notes and control values. We will build a simple system using the Arduino to send MIDI commands to a digital audio workstation.
 
## Week 3 [Tues, May 27th]:
Modular Synthesis: Using VCV Rack participants will explore sound design and music production using modular synthesis.
 
## Week 4 [Tues, June 3rd]:
Homebrew MIDI Controllers: Bringing together the previous three workshops, in this session, participants will build custom MIDI controllers using Arduino and various sensors.
